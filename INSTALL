| Building and installing porg |
+------------------------------+


Configure options
=================
You can get a summary of all configuration options with './configure --help'.
Some of them are explained below:


The prefix
----------
By default, porg is installed in prefix /usr/local. If you prefer a different
one, like /usr, use the '--prefix' configure option. For example like this:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr


The system-wide configuration directory
---------------------------------------
By default, the configuration file porgrc is installed in directory PREFIX/etc.
If you prefer a different one, like /etc, use the '--sysconfdir' configure
option.


The default log directory
-------------------------
By default, porg will store its logs in directory /var/log/porg. If you prefer a
different location, use the configure option '--with-porg-logdir=DIR'.
This will be the default log directory, but it's possible to specify a different
one in runtime, by setting the LOGDIR variable in the configuration file, or
using the porg command line option '--logdir=DIR'.


The GUI
-------
The GUI of porg (grop) can be disabled with the option '--disable-grop'.
Use this option if your system lacks GTKMM >= 3.4.0, or you don't want to use the
GUI.


Compiling and installing porg
=============================
Once you have choosen the appropiate options, just type the following to install
porg:

   ./configure [OPTIONS]
   make
   make install           # as root



Logging the installation of porg itself
=======================================
To log the own installation of porg, type the following command as root,
right after "make install":

	make logme

Don't try this:

    porg -lp porg-x.y make install

from the porg sources directory, because the install process will fail,
printing an error message, more or less like this:

    error while loading shared libraries: /usr/lib/libporg-log.so: cannot open
    shared object file: No such file or directory
