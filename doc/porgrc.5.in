.SH NAME
porgrc - configuration file for porg
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@sysconfdir@/porgrc\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBporgrc\fR is the system-wide configuration file for \fBporg(8)\fR,
the source code package organizer.
.SH SYNTAX
.PP
The file consists of comments and key-value pairs. Comments are on separate
lines that start with a \fB#\fR symbol. The key-value pairs are on the form:
.RS
.br
\fBkey=value\fR
.RE
.br
where \fBkey\fR contains no whitespace and no equal signs.
.br
\fBvalue\fR will be all of the text after the equal sign until (but not
including) the ending newline.
.br
Occurences of $HOME and ${HOME} in \fBvalue\fR are expanded to the value of
the environment variable HOME.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options can be set. The equivalent command line options (if any),
are listed in brackets:
.TP
\fBLOGDIR\fR [-L|--logdir]
.br
Base porg logs directory. Default is '@LOGDIR@'.
.TP
\fBMAX_DB_AGE\fR
.br
Maximmum database age (maximmum number of days since the last update of the
whole database). When this limit is reached porg prints a warning message.
If set to zero, the database is never considered too old. Default is 7.
.TP
\fBINCLUDE\fR [-I|--include]
.br
Colon-separated list of paths to scan when logging the installation of a
package. Default is '@INCLUDE@'.
.br
Shell wildcards are allowed in the paths. See \fIPATH MATCHING\fR below for
more details.
.TP
\fBEXCLUDE\fR [-E|--exclude]
.br
Colon-separated list of paths to skip when logging the installation of a
package. Default is '@EXCLUDE@'.
.br
Shell wildcards are allowed in the paths. See \fIPATH MATCHING\fR below for
more details.
.TP
\fBBLOCK_SIZE\fR
.br
File sizes in the logs are rounded up to the nearest multiple
of this value. This should be set to the block size of the file system. For
most systems this is 4096. If set to zero, porg retrieves the block size of
the file system for each file, which is the most accurate but time consuming
choice. Default is 0.
.br
Note: This is \fBnot\fR the same as the command line option \fB\-b\fR (or
\fB\-\-block\-size\fR).
.TP
\fBAPPARENT_SIZE\fR
.br
Like BLOCK_SIZE=1.
.TP
\fBLOG_IGNORE_ERRORS\fR [--ignore-errors]
.br
Setting this variable to 1 makes porg log packages even if the install command
fails. This allows for logging uncomplete installations, or clean the filesystem
after an installation failure. Default is 0.
.TP
\fBLOG_IGNORE_SHARED\fR [--ignore-shared]
.br
Setting this variable to 1 makes porg skip shared files when logging packages.
Default is 0.
.TP
\fBCASE_SENSITIVE\fR
.br
Setting this variable to 1 makes porg behave case-sensitively when matching the
package names given by the command line against the logged packages. Default is 0.
.SH PATH MATCHING
Variables \fB\INCLUDE\fR and \fBEXCLUDE\fR accept a colon-separated list of
paths, each of which may contain shell-like wildcards (*, ? and [..]).
Files are matched against each of those paths, following the standard
shell-like expansion, but with the following exception: If a path in the list
does not contain any wildcard, and it is a directory, it matches any file
within that directory.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Porg honours the following environment variable:
.TP
\fBPORG_DEBUG\fR
If set to "yes", porg produces debugging messages, like the command line
option '\fB\-vv\fR'.
