Q1: I can't use porg to log it's own installation: "error while loading shared
    libraries: /usr/lib/libporg-log.so: cannot open shared object file: No such
    file or directory"

R1: To log the own porg's installation, type "make logme" after "make install".


Q2: When building LFS, porg does not properly log the installation of glibc
    in chapter 6 (some files are not logged)

R2: This is because in the chapter 6 some of glibc files are installed
	using statically linked sln. To have a proper glibc log you can run the
	following in chroot after installing glibc:

		find /lib -type l | while read name
		do
			if [ "$(porg -f glibc | grep "$(readlink $name)")" != "" ]
			then
				echo $name
			fi
		done | porg -lp+ glibc-<GLIBC_VERSION>

	Or the following simpler command, if you run it right after installing
	glibc, and before installing any other package:
        
		find /lib | porg -lp+ glibc-<GLIBC_VERSION>


Q3: Why doesn't porg log directories?

R3: When a directory is created, using either mkdir or install, all the partial
    directories in its path need to be created too. Even if they already exist,
    the system call mkdir() may be called for every partial directory in the
    path. Thus, for example:

        $ porg -l 'install -d /usr/share/man/man1'

    would log the following directories:

        /usr
        /usr/share
        /usr/share/man
        /usr/share/man/man1

    And I think this would be a bad thing: All logs would be bloated with many
    directories, and the list of files could be too large. Also, most of the
    directories will be shared among many packages, resulting in a big mess...


Q4: Is it safe to launch porg with sudo?

R4: Yes. Here you can see a thread in the porg mailing list that discusses this
    issue:

Q5: Is it safe to launch sudo with porg?

R5: No. For example the command:

        porg -lp foobar-1.0 "sudo make install"

    would not produce any error message, and the package would be actually
    installed, but porg would not be able to monitor the installation and no
    files would be logged.
    This is due to LD_PRELOAD limitations on suid programs like sudo.
