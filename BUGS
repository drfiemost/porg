% Due to LD_PRELOAD limitations, when logging package installations all the
  executables must link libc dynamically. This makes porg unusable on FreeBSD
  and OpenBSD.

# When logging package installations, the files are not properly logged if the
  install commands are suid. The reason for this is that the dynamic library
  linker (ld) automatically rejects prelinking suid or sgid binaries against
  LD_PRELOAD libraries. This is not a bug but a security patch.
  
  For example, if you want to use the program sudo to install packages, you
  should wrap porg with sudo and not sudo with porg, because sudo is suid:
  
  	$ sudo porg -lp foo make install  # this would work fine
	
	$ porg sudo -lp foo make install  # the package foo would be installed, but
	                                  # porg wouldn't log anything.

@ In some cases, the LD_PRELOAD is not taken into account, for example Solaris
  cc doesn't recognize it (better use gcc ;-)
