	+ Simplified debug messages when logging packages.
	+ Fixed compilation error in Ubuntu (thanks Jerry Jacobs :-)
	+ [grop] Removed "Import RPM" feature.
	+ [grop] Fix package selection issues in the main window.

	Changes in grop:
	
	+ Moved configuration file from ~/.groprc to ~/.config/grop/groprc.
	+ Enhanced performance and fixed some minor bugs.


2.0.5 [27 Aug 2008]

	  cleared.
	+ [porgball] Archive symlinks to missing files too (thanks Sergei Butakov).
	+ [rpm2porg] Bugfix: Option -q caused the program to exit.


2.0.3 [17 Jul 2007]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	+ Removed repeated text in the man page of porg (thanks Georg
	  Grafendorfer).
	+ The option '-x|--expand' has been removed (though it is silently ignored
	  for backwards compatibility). Now the command line package names are
	  automatically expanded like in rpm(8), except when logging packages. In
	  this case the package name must be introduced exactly.
	+ Do not search for the name of the package in config.log (thanks Mirco
	  Lorenzoni).
	+ Fix a doubled DESTDIR bug in doc/Makefile (thanks Matthew Bruenig).
	+ Rewritten libporg-log in C. This prevents a glibc installation failure
	  when building LFS in chapter 6.
	+ Fixed bug that made porg log compressed files twice in some cases.
	+ Use RTLD_NEXT in libporg-log. Fixes bug in some systems (thanks Roland

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	+ Fixed rpm2porg and ocap scripts! (were broken in 2.0.0).
	+ Fixed compilation error in Fedora7 x86_64 (thanks Sawa).
	+ New command line option --log-missing.
	+ [grop] New feature "Import RPM database" (it is a graphic
	  frontend to rpm2porg).


2.0.0 [6 Jun 2007]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	Both porg and grop have been rewritten in C++.
	Grop uses (and depends on) the GTKMM libraries (the C++ bindings for GTK+).
	There is not backwards compatibility with porg-1 databases, but they can be
	updated automatically by running 'porg -au' right after installing porg-2.
	
	Please note that version 1 databases can be converted to version 2 without
	any information loss, but the opposite is not true, so it is advisable to
	backup old databases before upgrading.

	Changes in the user interface:
	------------------------------

	+ The default install prefix has been restored to /usr/local.
	+ New command line switch -B, which is an alias for --batch.
	+ New options --ignore-errors and --ignore-shared (see the man page of porg
	  for more details).
	+ The option -U is no longer used along with -r. The same effect can be now
	  achieved with -rr.
	+ The debuging messages have been slightly reformatted.
	+ PORG_INCLUDE and PORG_EXCLUDE environment variables are no longer honoured
	  when logging package installations. Porgrc options INCLUDE and EXCLUDE
	  should be used instead.
	+ The usage of options -c and -N have changed in order to achieve a more
	  consistent interface. Now they must be used toghether with -f and/or -m.
	  For example, to list the shared missing files use -cm, and to list all non
	  shared files use -Nfm.
	+ New porgrc variables LOG_IGNORE_SHARED and CASE_SENSITIVE (see the man
	  page of porgrc for more details).
	+ Always return the exit code of the install command when logging
	  installations, even if the option --ignore-errors is used (thanks Arthur
	  Demchenkov).
	+ [grop] New "Strip" feature in the file list context menu (by Victor
	  Ananjevsky).
	+ [grop] Yellow background for missing files is no longer used. Instead, a
	  new status column has been added in the list of files, showing whether the
	  file is installed or not. This column is sortable, allowing for easy
	  selection of files based on their existence.
	+ [grop] Remember the last selected folder, compression program and
	  compression level when creating binary packages.
	+ [rpm2porg] Rewritten in bash (it was bourne shell compatible).
	+ [rpm2porg] Upgraded to porg-2 databases.
	+ [rpm2porg] Already logged packages are now skipped by default. The new
	  option --force must be used to overwrite the old logs.
	+ [ocap] New option -L|--logdir.
	+ [ocap] Renamed option -V to -v (for --version).
	+ [porgball] The logs of the packages are included in the porgballs. Then
	  when extracting a porgball, the package information is restored again
	  (only if the extraction is logged, using option --log). Thanks Arthur Demchenkov.
	+ [porgball] Porgballs have now the suffix '.porg.tar.gz' instead of
	  '-porg.tar.gz'. Those created with grop follow the same rule.

	Internal changes / Fixed bugs:
	------------------------------

	+ The info logs (those in LOGDIR/_info/) have been removed. Now package
	  information is written in the same log as the list of installed files.
	  This is what makes porg-2 databases unusable with porg-1.
	+ The file config.status is not read when logging package installations,
	  since it is not fairly parsable.
	+ Properly keep track of directory renaming when logging installations (by
	  Vladimir A. Pavlov).
	+ In libporg-log, the global errno is saved and restored across handling of
	  system calls, thereby interfering minimally with the install process.
	  Also, files are logged only upon successful system calls. This fixes some
	  bugs (thanks Vladimir A. Pavlov).
	+ Do not print error messages when LOGDIR does not exist or is not writable.


1.10.12 [14 Nov 2006]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	+ Fixed another double free() bug in porg (thanks Mirco Lorenzoni)


1.10.11 [08 Nov 2006]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	
	+ Removed option '-V|--variable' in porg.
	+ Removed porgrc option CLEAR_EMPTY. Empty logs are allways removed from
	  the database.
	+ Fixed segmentation fault when reading empty lines from the configuration
	  file (thanks Roebe XXX).
	+ Updated the porg_bash_completion script (thanks Christian Schneider)
	+ [grop] Fixed a "Too many open files" bug when compressing a large number
	  of files.
	+ [grop] Fixed "double free" bug.


1.10.10 [29 Jul 2006]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	This release fixes a bug in release 1.10.9: porg made a segmentation fault
	when reading package information from setup.py
	

1.10.9 [28 Jul 2006]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	Porg:
	+ Allow shell wildcards in options -e, -E and -I (see the man page).
	+ Read information from setup.py when installing Python packages.
	+ Added a blank line between different packages when listing shared files.
	+ New option '-N|--non-shared', to list the non-shared files of the
	  packages (thanks Thomas Schwarzgruber).

	Grop:
	+ Remove obsolete info logs when updating the database (as in porg).
	+ Make the main window insensitive when updating the database.
	+ Removed the "Update" button in the list of files.
	+ Fixed an integer overflow in the number of missing files on 64 bit
	  architectures (thanks Christian Schneider).
	+ New option for testing the integrity of the binary packages.
	+ Make the columns in the main window reorderable, and remember its order
	  between sessions.
	+ New column "Summary" in the list of packages (thanks Mickael "Mega MoiX").
	+ New columns "Size %" and "Files %" in the list of packages.
	+ Use .ini-like syntax for the configuration file (~/.groprc)
	+ Changed selection behaviour in the list of files.
	+ Multiple package selection is now allowed.
	+ Minor bugfixes.

	Other:
	+ Porgball option '--prefix' renamed to '--root' (--prefix is still
	  supported to provide backwards compatibility).
	+ New options '--fakeroot' and '--test' in porgball.
	+ New script ocap. It scans the system and finds all files not logged in the
	  porg database.
	+ Added the porg_bash_completion script into the distribution.
	+ Removed configure option '--enable-wordexp'. Only the environment variable
	  HOME is honoured in porgrc.
	+ Removed configure options '--enable-ansi' and '--enable-werror'.
	+ Fixed doubled DESTDIRs in doc/Makefile.am (thanks Mark Rosenstand).
	

1.10.8 [26 May 2006]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	General:
	+ [bugfix]: Compilation errors in Solaris.
	+ [bugfix]: Segmentation fault if /etc/porgrc is missing.
	+ Added (more) missing DESTDIRs in Makefiles.
	+ New configure option '--enable-scripts' (see INSTALL).

	Porg:
	+ When removing packages, do not ask for confirmation to remove them from
	  the database. If the package is completely uninstalled it is automatically
	  removed from the database. If any file is not removed due to errors or
	  because it is shared, the package is not removed from the database unless
	  option -U is used.
	+ Enhanced the man pages.

	Grop:
	+ Integrated the "binary package" dialog into the window of the package, as
	  a new tab.
	+ Replaced progress dialogs by progress bars in the status bar.
	+ Prevent users without write permissions on the porg database to remove,
	  compress or uncompress files.
	+ Removed the (dangerous) button "Close" in the remove page.

	Sccripts:
	+ Removed option '-o' in porgball. Bugfixes and enhancements.
	+ Added script superporg into the main porg distribution. Added a new
	  option '-n|--no-porg' to install the packages without porg. Fixed a bug
	  that prevented symlinks and hidden files to be properly installed
	  (thanks Dan Nicholson and Thomas Schwarzgruber). Other bugfixes.
	+ Bugfix in porgball: Input tarballs not recognized.


1.10.7 [29 Apr 2006]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	+ [bugfix]: symlinks not logged (thanks Tor Olav and Thomas Schwarzgruber).
	+ New feature in grop: removing files can be interrupted with a "Stop"
	  button, and resumed again with a "Resume" button.
	+ New option '--owner', which is just a more intuitive alias for '--query'.
	+ Changed the behaviour of option '-V|--variable' (see the man page).
	+ Allow '--sort=time' as an alias for '--sort=date' in porg.
	+ Reintroduced the script porgball in the main porg distribution.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	+ [bugfix]: grop: files could not be manually removed, compressed or
	  uncompressed.
	+ [bugfix]: extra line read from info file broke option '-o'. (Thanks
	  Daniel Eklöf).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	+ Fixed compilation errors in NetBSD.
	+ New configure option "--enable-wordexp" (see INSTALL).
	+ Fixed a bug in 1.10.4 release that made porg skip /foobar files if

	+ Upgrade is recommended.
	

1.10.4 [1 Apr 2006]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	+ [bugfix]: option '-m' broken (missing files not listed).
	+ [bugfix]: EXCLUDE'd paths actually not excluded (thanks Kristian Gavran).
	+ [bugfix]: grop crashed when updating inexistent logs.
	+ Beautified the debugging output when logging packages.
	+ Restored the configure option "--with-porg-logdir".
	+ Added configure option "--enable-werror".
	+ Changed the default install prefix to /usr (was /usr/local).
	+ [grop]: fixed some problems when managing big packages.
	+ New options BLOCK_SIZE and LOG_IGNORE_ERRORS in porgrc.
	+ Expand any environment variable in porgrc (not only HOME); and more
	  (read the man page of porgrc for more information).
	+ Removed internationalisation.
	+ Type "make logme" right after installing porg, and it will log the own
	  porg's installation :-)
	+ Fixed more missing DESTDIRs in the Makefiles.
	+ Do not allow users to remove, update, log or unlog packages if they do not
	  have write permissions on the porg log directory (thanks Kristian Gavran).


1.10.3 [4 Mar 2006]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	+ Fixed missing DESTDIR in doc/Makefile (thanks Dan Nicholson).
	+ Tested successfully with gcc-4.0.0.
	+ Removed porg.spec from the tarball. Created porg.pc. This allows for
	  retrieving the porg log directory after installation with pkg-config,
	  like this: "pkg-config --variable=logdir porg".
	+ Allowed the use of option '-x|--expand' when logging packages. If the
	  expansion leads to more than one package name, porg prints an error
	  message and exits. See an example in the README file.
	+ Scripts are no longer included in the distribution. They have been
	  available in the web site (http://porg.sourceforge.net/downloads.html).
	+ [bugfix]: temporary files were not always removed at exit.
	+ Removed the option '--with-porg-logdir' in configure, since it can be set
	  in the configuration file.
	+ New options CLEAR_EMPTY and CLEAR_UNINSTALLED for porgrc. See the man page
	  of porgrc for more information.
	+ Minor bugfixes.


1.10.2 [6 Nov 2005]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	+ New option '--ignore-errors' in porg (see the man page).
	+ New configure option '--enable-ansi'.
	+ Allow the use of rpmunpack in SuperPorg (by Richard Johns). This means
	  that rpm2cpio is no longer required to install RPM packages.
	+ Removed reference to sudo conflict, which is not true (thanks Carlos
	  Vendramini).
	+ [bugfix]: option '-c' broken!
	+ [bugfix]: segfault in porg when reading badly formatted logs.
	+ [bugfix]: problems when creating binary packages in grop.
	+ [bugfix]: grop: When updating the database, newly logged packages were
	  duplicated in the list of packages.
	+ [bugfix]: segfault when reading long lines from the logs (thanks Mirco
	  Lorenzoni)
	+ [bugfix]: SuperPorg had problems when installing RPM packages:
	  "cp: cannot stat `foo': No such file or directory".


1.10.1 [27 Oct 2005]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	This release fixes an important bug in version 1.10.0: When logging
	installations, paths to be excluded were actually not excluded from the
	logs. Thanks Arthur Demchenkov for catching this horrible bug.
	

1.10.0 [23 Oct 2005]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	*** IMPORTANT: Notes for users of older versions of porg ***
	************************************************************
	1) There are changes in the log format. To rebuild the database, run
	   'porg -au' right after installing this new version.
	2) The libporg shared library has been renamed to libporg-log. Files
	   /usr/lib/libporg.* can be removed when upgrading to porg-1.10.0.
			   
	General changes
	---------------
	+ The configure script can be run from outside the main porg sources
	  directory (thanks Christian Schneider).
	+ Added russian translation (by Arthur Demchenkov).
	+ The syntax of porgrc is more strict. Quotes and spaces are not stripped
	  from the value of the variables. Type 'man porgrc' for more information.
	+ Fixed compilation errors in Solaris.

	Changes in porg
	---------------
	+ Enhanced the debugging messages when logging or removing packages.
	+ Resolve intermediate directory symlinks in the names of the logged files
	  (no more conflicts with /usr/man and /usr/share/man, etc).
	+ Enhanced the way to collect package information at log time: Builds from
	  outside the main package sources directory are supported, and the
	  config.status and .aspec (autopackage) files are scanned.
	+ When logging packages, the values of CC, CFLAGS, etc... are retrieved only
	  from the environment, and not from the Makefile.
	+ [bugfix]: Spurious commented lines in "Description" info field.

	Changes in grop
	----------------
	+ [bugfix]: configuration file (.groprc) not well written at exit.
	+ [bugfix]: charset encoding problems (thanks Arthur Demchenkov).
	+ [bugfix]: memory leaks.
	+ [bugfix]: segfault when removing packages.
	+ [bugfix]: problems with long package descriptions (thanks Christoph Berg).
	+ Removed the "maximmum database age" setting in "Preferences". Never update
	  the database at start.
	

1.9.6 [23 Sep 2005]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	+ Fixed a bug on Solaris: "ld.so.1: sh: fatal: /usr/lib/libporg.: open
	  failed: No such file or directory".


1.9.5 [23 Sep 2005]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	+ Porg has been successfully tested on NetBSD-2.0 (thanks Tanaka Shin-ya).
	+ Fixed error codes when using the '-l' option to monitor a command.
	  Now porg returns: 0 on success, 1 if porg itself fails, and 2 if the
	  failure comes from the monitorized command (thanks Dan Nicholson).
	+ Expand variable $HOME (or ${HOME}) in porgrc (thanks XMail-LORD).
	+ Fixed memory leaks.
	+ [bugfix]: "true_fopen64 undeclared" (thanks Tanaka Shin-ya).
	+ [bugfix]: "__unused redefined" (thanks Christian Schneider).
	+ [bugfix]: Segmentation fault when dealing with filenames containing the
	  percent ('%') character (thanks Christian Schneider).
	+ [bugfix]: Fixed some serious bugs in superporg (ooopss...).
	+ [bugfix]: "too many open files" when removing packages.
	

1.9.4 [5 Sep 2005]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	This release fixes a bug in porg-1.9.3: When logging installations, the
	package information was not properly retrieved.


1.9.3 [4 Sep 2005]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	Changes in porg:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	+ Removed option '-S|--stdin'. From now on, if the option '-l|--log' is
	  used without any command, files are read from the standard input, just
	  like the '-S' option did. Update your scripts!
	+ The build-time values of CC, CFLAGS and some other variables are now
	  saved in the database, and retrieved with the new option '-V|--variable'.
	+ Due to the above new feature, the short option '-V' has changed its
	  meaning and it's no more used to show version information.
	+ [bugfix] '-C' option printed 0 shared files for all packages!
	+ [bugfix] Bogus error messages were printed when removing packages.
	+ [internal] Use GNU getopt to parse the command line options.
	+ [internal] Use linked lists for the lists of files.
	
	Changes in grop:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	+ Added translator credits in the "About" dialog.
	+ Added accelerator to option "Update database" (Ctrl+U).
	+ [bugfix] Wrong "parse error" failure when updating the database.
	+ [bugfix] Newly logged packages were not properly updated when updating
	  the whole database.
	+ [bugfix] Bogus error messages were printed when removing packages.

	Other changes:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	+ Replaced the configure option '--enable-scripts' with new options
	  '--enable-a2porg', '--enable-superporg' and '--enable-porgball'.
	+ New script porg_bash_completion, written by Christian Schneider.
	+ Let porgball accept more than one input package.
	+ New options '-1|--faster', '-9|--better' and '-a|--all' in porgball.
	+ Created a man page for porgball.
	+ Removed configuration variable DPKGDIR.
	+ Added Serbian translation (Boban Petrovic).
	+ Updated French translation (Ookaze BioACobol).
	+ Updated Catalan translation (me).


1.9.2 [03 Aug 2005]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	This release uses the full GNU build system: autoconf, automake and libtool.
	
	*** IMPORTANT: Due to the use of libtool, porg can't track its own
	*** installation anymore. See the INSTALL file for more details.
	
	General changes:
	================
	+ The default log directory can be set at configure time, with the option
	  '--with-porg-logdir=DIR'.
	+ The path '/usr/info/dir' has been added to the default value of EXCLUDE.
	  Now EXCLUDE='/tmp:/usr/src:/usr/info/dir'.
	+ New configuration variable APPARENT_SIZE (See the man page of porgrc).
	+ (Apparently, hopefully) ported to Solaris 9.

	I18n:
	=====
	+ Internationalizated grop.
	+ Updated French translation (Ookaze BioACobol).
	+ Updated Catalan translation (me).

	Changes in libporg:
	===================
	+ Added truncate(), truncate64() and creat64() handlers.
	+ Bugfixes.

	Changes in porg:
	================
	+ Removed the '--usage' option and the '?' switch.
	+ Don't print the date and the size of the package when listing files.
	
	Changes in grop:
	=================
	+ Disallow changing the log directory at runtime (for now).
	+ Don't permit multiple selection in the list of packages (for now).

	- Enhanced the man page and the INSTALL file.
	- New script 'porgball' (very simple): Creates binary .tar.bz2 or .tar.gz
	  packages from installed (and logged) packages.
	- From now on, scripts are not installed by default. There's a new configure
	  option '--enable-scripts' to install them.

	- New dialog "Search" which does the same as 'porg -q' but graphically.
	- Show progress bar when compressing/uncompressing more than 1MB.

	Other changes:
	- Logs ending with '~'	or '.bak' are ignored.

	USERS OF PORG < 1.8.0 SHOULD READ "UPGRADE"
	

1.8.3 [14 Feb 2005]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	Changes in grop:
	- Added file compression/uncompression support.
	- Beautified the "Properties" page in the package windows.

	  automatically applied when updating the porg database with 'porg -au'.

	USERS OF PORG < 1.8.0 SHOULD READ doc/UPGRADE


1.8.2 [06 Feb 2005]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	- This release fixes an important bug in porg-1.8.1, due to a typo: The 
	  configuration file was not properly parsed.
	- There's also a new useful option '-o|--configure-options', which prints
	  the options passed to configure when the package was installed.
	- Minor bugfixes in grop.
	

1.8.1 [04 Feb 2005]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	This release fixes the "rubbish in missing files" bug.
	Thanks MrPeacock.
	

1.8.0 [03 Feb 2005]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR USERS OF PORG < 1.8.0
	-------------------------------------------
	This release incorporates two important changes:
	
	1) The syntax of the logs has changed. Users of previous versions of porg
	   should run the 'upgrade' script provided with the porg-1.8.0 tarball
	   in order to convert the logs to the new format. Type 'upgrade --help'
	   for more information.
	   
	2) New locations for the default configuration files and log directory:
	   porg conf. file	= /etc/porgrc	(customizable with '--sysconfdir' opt.)
	   log directory	= /var/log/porg (customizable with '--logdir' opt.)
	   grop conf. file = ~/.groprc
	
	Thanks Paul Heldens for the aid.
	
	Changes in porg
	---------------
	- [Bugfix] Sizes of packages bigger than 1MB were wrong.
	- [Bugfix] Properly deal with defines in .spec files.
	- Adjust the 'porg -i' output to the screen width.
	- porg -vv produces debug messages.
	- Recursively remove empty directories when removing a package (also in
	  grop).
	- New option '-n|--missing-size', to show the missing size of the packages.
	  To achieve this, porg keeps the sizes of the missing files in the logs,
	  hence the change in the log format.
	  From 1.8.0 on, when listing files, the sizes of the missing ones won't be
	  '?' anymore. When dealing with logs created by earlier versions, those
	  sizes will be zero. But for packages logged by porg >= 1.8.0 the original
	  sizes of the missing files will be shown.
	- Due to the above new option, there's a new accepted argument to the
	  option '--sort': it's 'missing-size'. Also the argument 'missing' has
	  been renamed to 'missing-files'.
	- Slight change in the '-c' option usage. See the man page.
	- New option '--usage' to show option summary.
	- Added long option to '-D' switch. It's '--dirname'.
	
	Changes in grop
	----------------
	- Properly sort the list of packages or files by name (case insensitive).
	- Added two new columns in the main window, one for the icon and one for
	  the missing size of the packages.
	- Show the icon of the package in "Properties".
	- Renamed the grop icon gp.png to grop.png. Now it's installed in
	  DATADIR/pixmaps instead of DATADIR/porg to follow the GNOME conventions.
	  For the same reason, grop.desktop has been created.
	- Beautified (well I think) the "About grop" dialog.
	- Restore the scrolling status of the package windows after update.
	- Emulate a console when removing a package (black background, courier
	  font).
	- Show a progress bar while updating the database.
	- Code cleanup!
	
	THANKS THE GTK+ TEAM FOR THEIR EFFORT IN GREAT DOCUMENTATION.
	
	Other changes
	-------------
	- Removed options --include and --exclude from configure and a2porg.
	- Removed options --logdir and --overwrite from a2porg.
	- Various bugfixes in superporg and a2porg.
	- Directory DATADIR/porg (usually /usr/share/porg) has become obsolete.
	  Users of this new release of porg may safely remove it.

	porg:
	- Added option -D: When logging a package, use the name of the current

	  from stdin, instead of following the execution of a command.
	- Added options -Ccw, to query for the shared files of the packages.
